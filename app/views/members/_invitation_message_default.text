Dear <%%= dndname %>,

Your transition to the new Blitz system has been scheduled for the week of <%%= week_of_date %>.  To help make your transition as smooth as possible, we need information about your current e-mail and calendar accounts, your computer and other devices (including smartphones), and the software you use now and plan to use with the new Blitz system.

Please go to our online form at <http://migrations.dartmouth.edu/> and create a user profile as soon as possible -- it will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.  Fill out as much of the information as you can. If you are unsure of anything, contact your department's IT consultant or the IT Service Desk at 646-2999.

We will use this information to determine how we can best support your transition to the new Blitz system.  Thanks for your prompt attention to this request!
